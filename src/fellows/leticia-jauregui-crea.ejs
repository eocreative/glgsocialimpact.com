                Leticia Jauregui founded Crea Comunidades de Emprendedores Sociales (CREA) in 2008 to support Mexican female-led micro enterprises, focusing primarily on the manufacturing sector of food and handmade products and accessories. She has presented her work about remittances and micro entrepreneurial development at the Wharton School of Business, the Institute for Mexicans Abroad, the Organization of American States, and the OECD, among others. Her recognition since then includes the StartingBloc and Opportunity Collaboration Cordes Fellowships in 2010; being named an “Architect of the Future” by the Wazdell Institute in 2009, and the Echoing Green Fellowship in 2008. Leticia has two bachelors’ degrees from ITAM and two masters’ degrees from the University of California Davis. She lives in Mexico City.
