                <strong>Who qualifies for the GLG Social Impact Fellowship?</strong><br>
                Fellows are leaders with strong records and visions for their organizations. They have great teams and do something innovative that’s likely to scale. They are personally committed to learning, excited to grow professionally, and articulate ambitions for their organizations’ growth.
              </p>

              <p class="highlight">
                <strong>What happens after the Fellowship ends? Is there an opportunity to remain part of the GLG community?</strong><br>
                GLG is committed to creating lasting partnerships with our Fellowship alumni. They will certainly remain part of GLG’s learning community after the Fellowship, typically with less intensive/frequent engagement than during their active Fellowship.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p class="highlight">
                <strong>What is the anticipated time commitment?</strong><br>
                This opportunity will be what you make it. We want to be an extension of your team and engage with you consistently. The Fellowship requires a senior-level commitment to drive value through GLG membership, in addition to the kickoff on October 19–21, 2015.
