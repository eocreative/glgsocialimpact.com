                  Annie Ryu is a social entrepreneur and a Resolution Fellow. Her social venture, Global Village Fruit, brings jackfruit products from India to the global marketplace. Jackfruit is an abundant tree-borne fruit and a nutritious meat substitute. Annie came to GLG through our relationship with The Resolution Project, seeking expertise in packaging and product design and learned critical insight from the former VP of Marketing for Beyond Meat. Through this engagement, Annie learned how to position and sell her products in the U.S.; Global Village Fruit will hit the shelves of Whole Foods this summer.
